## 🖼️ Dashboard Highlights

| Visualization | What you learn |
|---------------|----------------|
| **Top Products by Sales** | Health, watches, and sports are revenue leaders. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} |
| **Sales by State** | São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Minas Gerais dominate regional sales. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5} |
| **Quarterly Trend** | Peak in Q2 hints at seasonal promos. |
| **Delayed vs. On‑Time Orders** | Spikes flag supply‑chain issues in specific months. |
| **Ratings (Top & Bottom 10)** | Security devices score highest; diapers need attention. |
| **Payment Mix** | Credit cards lead, followed by boleto and vouchers. |

> ### Key Insights & Recommendations  
> * Double‑down marketing on **health** and **watches** categories.  
> * Optimize logistics for **furniture** and **electronics** where delays cluster.
